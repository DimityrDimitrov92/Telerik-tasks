        //The card faces should start from 2 to A(10 is 10).
        //Print each card face in its four possible suits: clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades.
        //Input
        //On the only line, you will receive the sign of the card to which, including, you should print the cards in the deck.
        //Output
        //The output should follow the format bellow(assume our input is 5):
        //2 of spades, 2 of clubs, 2 of hearts, 2 of diamonds
        //3 of spades, 3 of clubs, 3 of hearts, 3 of diamonds
        //...
        //5 of spades, 5 of clubs, 5 of hearts, 5 of diamonds
        //Constraints
        //The input character will always be a valid card sign.
